		"Buena GmbH was founded with a clear mission: property ownership should be simple, and nobody should have to become a professional in rental, marketing, and administration just to prepare for retirement. We recognized that property ownership often becomes time-intensive, non-transparent, and costly, causing owners to forget why they acquired property in the first place.",
		"Our comprehensive approach encompasses three distinct service tiers: single unit management for individual apartment owners, entire building management for sole building owners, and specialized WEG administration for co-owners of multi-party buildings. Each service is designed to address the specific needs of different property ownership structures.",
		"Today, we operate across all of Germany from our headquarters in Berlin, with teams in Leipzig, Munich, Frankfurt am Main, Cologne, Hamburg, and Stuttgart. Licensed under ยง 34c Abs. 1 GewO and supervised by Bezirksamt Mitte von Berlin, we provide professional property management services that allow property owners to focus on their investment strategy rather than operational complexities."
